Provisional repository for Icelandic PoS corpora in Faroese PoS scheme

Currently this repo contains the MIM-GOLD corpus, converted to the Faroese PoS tagging scheme, originally used in the Faroese Sosialurin corpus. 

The corpus is presented as a whole and preprocessed for use in 10-fold cross valdation.
